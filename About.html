    <p> <span>I’m a dedicated full-stack developer</span> with a solid foundation in computer maintenance and technical troubleshooting, developed during my time at Waidel Automation Inc. My early experience working directly with hardware and software systems helped me build a strong attention to detail and a problem-solving mindset—skills I now apply to building efficient, scalable web applications.

Today, I focus on delivering full-stack solutions that combine clean, responsive front-end design with stable, well-structured back-end functionality. Whether it's developing a dynamic website, optimizing system performance, or troubleshooting issues, I always aim to provide practical, client-centered solutions that meet real-world needs.

I’m passionate about continuous growth in the tech field and committed to helping businesses bring their ideas to life through reliable and modern web development. </p>
